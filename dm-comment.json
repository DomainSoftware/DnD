The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and something... otherworldly. In the distance, you hear the faint echo of dripping water.\n\nBut wait—what's that sound? A guttural chittering echoes from the northern chamber! Your hand instinctively moves to your weapon as a **grotesque goblin scout** emerges from the shadows, its yellow eyes gleaming with malice, clutching a rusty dagger. The creature lets out a shriek and assumes a hostile stance!\n\nTo the south, barely visible in the torchlight, you notice an **ancient wooden chest** sitting against the wall, its surface covered in dust and cobwebs. What secrets might it hold?\n\n**Current Game State:**\n```\n#####\n#.G.#  (G = Hostile Goblin Scout, 7 HP)\n#...#\n#.C.#  (C = Ancient Treasure Chest)\n#####\n```\n\n**What Changed:**\n- Added hostile **Sneaky Goblin Scout** at northern position (2, 1) - 7 HP, armed with rusty dagger\n- Placed **Ancient Treasure Chest** at southern position (2, 3)\n  - Contains: Potion of Minor Healing (restores 2d4+2 HP)\n  - Contains: 25 Gold Coins with ancient dragon symbols\n- Enhanced the dungeon with atmospheric lore and environmental storytelling\n- The walls pulse with faint blue runic magic\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n- Use `/look` to survey your surroundings and see where you spawn\n- Use `/move <direction>` to navigate the dungeon (north, south, east, west)\n- Face the goblin in combat (future feature)\n- Investigate the mysterious chest\n- Explore the glowing runes on the walls\n\n---\n*\"Every great adventure begins with a single step into the unknown.
