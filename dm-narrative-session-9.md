🎲 **The Dungeon Master stirs...**

*As consciousness returns, you find yourself standing in a damp stone chamber. The air is thick with the smell of ancient dust and dampness. This place feels old—very old. Forgotten by the world above.*

*A single torch flickers on the wall before you, its dancing flames casting long, wavering shadows across rough-hewn stones. Each drip of distant water echoes through unseen passages, a rhythmic reminder that you are deep, deep underground.*

*What brought you to this forsaken place? Adventure? Treasure? Destiny? Perhaps you don't remember. But one thing is certain: the only way out is forward, into the unknown depths of these ancient ruins.*

**Current Chamber:**

**What You Notice:**
- Ancient stone walls, slick with moisture
- A torch mounted on the wall, providing the only light
- Multiple passages leading into darkness
- Strange runes barely visible on some stones
- The oppressive weight of countless tons of rock above

**Atmosphere:**
- **Setting:** A damp stone chamber deep beneath forgotten ruins
- **Mood:** Mysterious and foreboding
- **Sounds:** Dripping water, your own breathing, the crackle of the torch

*"Welcome, brave adventurer, to the depths of mystery and danger. Your story begins here, in the darkness beneath the world. What legends will you create in these forgotten halls?"* 🐉
