🎲 **The Dungeon Master stirs...**

As you step into the ancient dungeon, your torch flickers to life, casting dancing shadows across stone walls carved with mysterious glowing runes. The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and something... otherworldly. In the distance, you hear the faint echo of dripping water.

But wait—what's that sound? A guttural chittering echoes from the northern chamber! Your hand instinctively moves to your weapon as a **grotesque goblin scout** emerges from the shadows, its yellow eyes gleaming with malice, clutching a rusty dagger. The creature lets out a shriek and assumes a hostile stance!

To the south, barely visible in the torchlight, you notice an **ancient wooden chest** sitting against the wall, its surface covered in dust and cobwebs. What secrets might it hold?
