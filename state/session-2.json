Blood pools beneath them as they struggle to pull themselves free, their screams echoing through the ancient dungeon. They've taken 8 points of grievous damage and are bleeding profusely (HP: 2/10)."

  "dmNotes": "Gruesome spike trap encounter - player barely survived. The rust on the spikes suggests potential infection if not treated. Blood trail will attract predators."
