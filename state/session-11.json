    "🎲 **The Dungeon Master stirs...**\n\nYou stand at the entrance of **The Whispering Catacombs**, an ancient burial chamber lost beneath centuries of forgotten history. The air is thick with moisture and the scent of aged stone. Your torch flickers, casting dancing shadows that seem almost alive.\n\nAs you step inside, the temperature drops sharply. The walls are lined with crumbling stonework, and somewhere in the distance, you hear it—a faint whisper, like voices carried on a spectral wind. Are they warnings? Beckoning calls? Or merely the echo of water dripping in unseen passages?\n\n**Current Game State:**\n```\n#####\n#...#  (A small chamber awaits)\n#...#\n#...#\n#####\n```\n\n**What You Know:**\n- The chamber is small but appears stable\n- Faint whispers echo from unknown depths\n- Your torch reveals ancient stonework of masterful craftsmanship\n- The air carries the weight of centuries\n\n**Legends speak of:**\n- Treasures buried with the honored dead\n- Forgotten knowledge inscribed on hidden walls\n- Dangers that protect what should remain undisturbed\n\n---\n*\"Every dungeon has a story, brave adventurer. Will yours be one of glory, or cautionary tale?\"* 🗡️"
